# Hi, I'm Jessica

## Introduction

Hi there. My name is Jessica Turner, and I am a frontend developer born and raised in the Bay Area, and soon to be living outside Atlanta, GA. I work primarily with Vue, Nuxt and WordPress, but also have experience with Node, Express and React. I am diligently working to expand my technical knowledge and skills, especially with backend development.

## Why this blog

This blog started off as a project for a Udemy [Full-Stack Nuxt course](https://www.udemy.com/course/master-nuxt-full-stack-complete-guide/) by Piotr Jura. In creating the blog, I saw the opportunity to document things I am learning along the way. Everything form addressing SEO challenges to resolving bugs, adopting best practices for module setup, and exploring what works and what doesn't—I aim to share insights that can benefit both myself and fellow developers, whether new or experienced, in navigating their own projects. This documentation not only tracks my progress and problem-solving strategies but also aspires to offer guidance and solutions to others in the development community.
