## What is Vue 3?

Vue.js is a progressive JavaScript framework used for building user interfaces (UIs) and single-page applications (SPAs). It's designed to be incrementally adoptable, meaning you can integrate Vue.js into existing projects or start fresh with Vue.js as the core framework.

Vue.js focuses on the view layer of your application, providing tools and patterns for building reactive, component-based UIs. It uses a declarative approach, allowing you to describe your UI's structure and behavior using simple templates and data bindings.



## Why choose Vue?
1. **Reactivity:**
 Vue.js automatically updates the DOM when your data changes, making it easy to create dynamic and responsive UIs.
2. **Components:**
 Vue.js encourages building UIs as reusable components, which can be composed together to create complex interfaces.
3. **Directives:**
 Directives are special attributes in the markup that allow you to apply reactive behavior to HTML elements. Examples include v-if, v-for, and v-model.
4. **Two-Way Data Binding:**
 Vue.js supports two-way data binding, meaning changes to UI elements can update the underlying data, and changes to data can update the UI.
5. **Virtual DOM:**
 Vue.js uses a virtual DOM to optimize rendering performance by minimizing DOM manipulations.
6. **Lifecycle Hooks:** 
 Vue.js provides lifecycle hooks that allow you to run code at specific stages of a component's lifecycle, such as created, mounted, updated, and destroyed.

## Getting Started with Vue 3

Here's a basic Vue 3 application setup:

```javascript
const {createApp } = Vue
const app = createApp({
    data() {
        return{
            message: 'Hello Vue 3!'
        }
    }
})
app.mount('#app')
```
